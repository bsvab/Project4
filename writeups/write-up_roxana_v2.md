# Geochemical Data Analysis and Lithium Concentration Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Introduction

In this report, we present a comprehensive analysis of geochemical data of produced water samples, obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/64fa1e71d34ed30c2054ea11). Our objective is to apply statistical and machine learning techniques to predict Lithium (Li) concentrations. This analysis encompasses data preprocessing, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering analysis, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing.

## Data Preparation

The raw dataset was subjected to several preprocessing steps to ensure its readiness for analysis:

- **General Cleaning**: Irrelevant columns, such as identifiers and categorical data, were removed. This step was crucial to focus the analysis on quantitative geochemical features.
- **Well Type Filtering**: To ensure our study focused on the high-salinity produced water typical in oil and gas operations, we excluded well samples from coal, injection, and geothermal plays. This approach keeps our analysis relevant to the typical environmental and production challenges in the oil and gas industry.
- **Basin Categorization**: Well samples were categorized based on the basin they belong to. This categorization helps to group samples by geographical and geological features.
- **Technical Cleaning**: In the dataset preprocessing phase, observations with Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels below 10,000 parts per million (ppm) were excluded. This threshold was established based on the consideration that waters with TDS levels below this mark are typically characterized as brackish and are often subjected to treatment processes for various uses, including agricultural and industrial applications. Conversely, waters with TDS exceeding 10,000 ppm are generally associated with greater environmental challenges, requiring more rigorous management strategies to mitigate potential adverse ecological impacts. By focusing on samples with higher TDS levels, the analysis targets the subset of produced water that is more likely to raise environmental and disposal concerns, thus providing a more relevant framework for examining geochemical data in the context of environmental science and hydrology.

## Machine Learning Models and Scenarios
We employed various machine learning models including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Regression across two scenarios:

- **Scenario 1 (Imputed Dataset)**: Utilized an enhanced dataset with imputed missing values.
- **Scenario 2 (PCA-Transformed Dataset)**: Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality, focusing on the first 10 principal components capturing over 90% of data variance.

### Imputation Strategy
  For geochemical datasets, where the variables often exhibit complex interdependencies, simplistic imputation methods such as substitution by mean, median, or extremities like minimum and maximum values may not adequately capture the intrinsic variability and can potentially introduce biases. To address the missing data in our dataset, we utilized an Iterative Imputer, employing a RandomForestRegressor as the estimator. This advanced imputation technique considers the entire variable distribution and the stochastic nature of the dataset, thereby preserving the inherent multivariate relationships among geochemical parameters. It is especially critical in PCA, which requires a complete dataset as missing values can significantly distort the principal components derived from the analysis.

## Geochemical Data Analysis

### Clustering Analysis

A clustering analysis using the K-Means algorithm was conducted, revealing distinct spatial clusters in the data:

- **Spatial Clustering**: The latitude and longitude were used to identify six clusters, potentially indicating geochemical similarities based on location.

### Regression Analysis

We explored the relationships between Li concentration and other geochemical parameters using regression analysis:

- **Li Concentration vs. TDS**: A statistically significant positive correlation was identified, implying a relationship between increased TDS and Li concentration.
- **Li Concentration vs. Depth**: Analysis showed a positive correlation, suggesting that depth might influence Li concentration in the wells.

### Hypothesis Testing

Statistical tests were conducted to verify the significance of the relationships observed:

- **Li and TDS**: The strong correlation was confirmed to be statistically significant, indicating a genuine relationship across the dataset.
- **Li and Depth**: The positive correlation was statistically significant, albeit with a lower correlation coefficient compared to the Li-TDS correlation.


## Heatmap Analysis
Through heatmap analysis, we have examined the correlations between Lithium (Li) concentrations and various geochemical parameters across multiple basins. The following section elucidates the distinct geochemical signatures observed in each basin and discusses the implications of these findings for predicting Lithium concentrations.

### Basin-Specific Correlations with Lithium
Our heatmap analysis yielded a wealth of insights, pinpointing the top three geochemical features most correlated with Lithium in each basin:

- **Appalachian Basin**: Strontium (Sr) and Barium (Ba) emerged as the most correlated features with Lithium, with correlation coefficients of 0.557 and 0.529 respectively.

- **Permian Basin**: Zinc (Zn) displayed a remarkably high correlation with Lithium at 0.774, followed by Sr and Sodium (Na).

- **Oklahoma Platform Basin**: Here, Sr was again prominent with a correlation of 0.529, alongside Potassium (K) and Calcium (Ca), with correlations of 0.425 and 0.365.

- **Gulf Coast Basin**: Boron (B) and Bromine (Br) showed strong correlations with Lithium at 0.634 and 0.632, respectively, while Ca also demonstrated a notable correlation of 0.546.

- **Williston Basin**: Exhibited extremely high correlations with Barium and Boron at around 0.98 for both, indicating a significant geochemical interplay with Lithium.

- **Michigan Basin**: Zinc displayed a perfect correlation with Lithium, followed by Br and Ca with strong correlations of 0.845 and 0.755.

- **Rocky Mountain Basin**: Presented Na, TDS, and Chloride (Cl) as the most correlated with Lithium, though the coefficients were modest, all hovering around 0.3.

- **Fort Worth Basin**: Iron Total (FeTot) had a perfect correlation with Lithium, while Ca and Ba also showed very strong correlations, with coefficients above 0.86.

### Implications for Machine Learning
The disparities in geochemical correlations with Lithium across basins underscore the complexity of geochemical interactions within distinct geological settings. In some basins, certain elements exhibit extremely strong, if not perfect, correlations with Lithium, suggesting a potential for direct predictive modeling of Lithium concentrations based on these elements.

In other basins, such as the Rocky Mountain, the correlations are less pronounced, which may necessitate a more nuanced approach to modeling that incorporates a broader array of features or perhaps the development of basin-specific prediction models.

For machine learning applications, these findings inform feature selection, allowing us to tailor our predictive models to include the most relevant geochemical parameters for each basin. The highlighted correlations will serve as the foundation for the feature sets in regression analysis and other predictive modeling techniques aimed at estimating Lithium concentrations.

By concentrating on the most influential parameters as indicated by the heatmap analysis, we aim to enhance model accuracy and interpretability while mitigating the risk of multicollinearity and overfitting.

## Predictive Modeling

### Gradient Boosting for Lithium Concentration Prediction

Employing Gradient Boosting Regression, we derived predictions for Li concentrations, relying on performance metrics for model validation and leveraging visual plots for a comparative assessment of actual vs. predicted values. This approach was chosen due to its robustness in handling nonlinear relationships and its ability to handle the variance explained by the principal components effectively.

### Methodology

Gradient Boosting Regressor from scikit-learn, configured with 100 estimators, a 0.1 learning rate, and a maximum depth of 3, was employed to balance complexity with performance. Both the imputed dataset and the PCA-transformed dataset were split into training and testing sets, allocating 20% for evaluation.

### Model Training and Evaluation

For each basin, the model was trained on the known Lithium concentrations and evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Explained Variance. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's accuracy and its ability to generalize to new data.

- **MSE and RMSE** offer measures of the average error magnitude, with RMSE giving more weight to larger errors.
- **MAE** provides a straightforward average of error magnitudes.
- **R2** indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.
- **Explained Variance** measures how well our model accounts for the variation in the dataset.

### Predictive Performance

- Anadarko Basin (with PCA): Achieves an R^2 of 0.65, showing a decent model performance with PCA data, indicating that the principal components adequately capture the significant geochemical variations.
- Appalachian Basin (with PCA): Exhibits an R^2 of 0.66, which suggests effective model performance, capturing most of the relevant geochemical interactions after PCA transformation.
- Fort Worth Basin (with PCA): Shows a moderate R^2 of 0.53, suggesting that some essential data might be lost during the PCA process, affecting the model's accuracy.
- Great Plains Basin (with PCA): Presents an R^2 near zero, reflecting very poor model performance, possibly due to PCA oversimplification or inherent complexities within the -basin not being captured.
- Gulf Coast Basin (with PCA): Registers a negative R^2 value, indicating that the model performs worse than a simple mean-based prediction, suggesting significant issues with the PCA model in this context.
- Appalachian Basin (without PCA): Shows an improved R^2 of 0.71 compared to the PCA model, indicating that using the full dataset without reducing dimensionality enhances model performance.
- Permian Basin (without PCA): Displays a low R^2 of 0.05, pointing to challenges in modeling this basin's geochemical data accurately, even with the full set of features.
- Oklahoma Platform (without PCA): Registers an R^2 of 0.31, reflecting modest predictive capabilities with ample room for improvement.
- Gulf Coast Basin (without PCA): Achieves an R^2 of 0.81, significantly higher than its PCA counterpart, demonstrating that full data utilization without PCA leads to a much more accurate model.
- Williston Basin (without PCA): With an R^2 of 0.94, this model shows exceptional performance, indicating that the comprehensive feature set is very effective in capturing the nuances of the basin's geochemistry.

Generally, models trained on the full set of imputed data without PCA perform better than their PCA-transformed counterparts. This trend suggests that the reduction of dimensionality through PCA might lead to the loss of critical information necessary for making accurate predictions in certain basins.
Basins with complex geochemical backgrounds, such as the Great Plains and Gulf Coast, show varied responses to PCA, with significant performance degradation noted when critical variables are potentially omitted during dimensionality reduction.
Basins like the Williston and Gulf Coast (without PCA) illustrate that a comprehensive approach, utilizing all available geochemical parameters, can substantially enhance model accuracy, especially in regions with complex interactions.

The summarized performance of Gradient Boosting models indicates that while PCA can be useful for simplifying models and reducing computational burdens, its applicability should be carefully considered. In cases where geochemical data is complex and interactions are nuanced, retaining the full spectrum of data without PCA often yields better predictive outcomes.

### Random Forest for Lithium Concentration Prediction

### Methodology
The Random Forest models were implemented using the scikit-learn library, optimized for geochemical data analysis to predict lithium concentrations. Each model configuration was adapted to handle different data scenarios effectively:
- **Random Forest Setup**: The model utilized a Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning method known for its robustness and accuracy in regression tasks. The forest comprised multiple decision trees, whose parameters were fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: A grid search was conducted to find the optimal model settings, utilizing a parameter grid that included:

    - ***Number of Estimators***: Options of 100, 200, 300 trees to explore the effect of forest size on performance.
    - ***Maximum Depth***: Tree depths of None (fully grown trees), 10, and 20 to control overfitting.
    - ***Minimum Samples Split***: Minimum number of samples required to split a node set at 2, 5, and 10, impacting the model's sensitivity to data variance.
    - ***Minimum Samples Leaf***: Minimum number of samples required at a leaf node, tested with 1, 2, and 4, which helps in stabilizing the predictions across diverse data points.

For data handling, two scenarios were utilized:

- **PCA-Transformed Data**: The models were fed the first 10 principal components, representing over 90% of the variance in the dataset, to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most significant features.
- **Imputed Data Without PCA**: The models used the full set of imputed geochemical features to capture all potential interactions and provide a comprehensive basis for prediction.

Both datasets were divided into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data allocated for model training and 20% reserved for model evaluation.

### Predictive Performance
Models that surpass the R^2 threshold of 0.75 demonstrate excellent predictive capabilities, suggesting that the models have captured the essential geochemical interactions required for accurate predictions:

- Gulf Coast Basin (Without PCA): Achieves an R^2 of 0.89, indicating outstanding model performance and effective capture of complex geochemical patterns using the full set of imputed features.
- Williston Basin (Without PCA): With an R^2 of 0.93, this basin shows superior model accuracy, benefiting significantly from the detailed geochemical data provided without PCA reduction.
- Anadarko Basin (With PCA): An R^2 of 0.61 suggests that while the PCA model captures significant variance, it may not fully encompass the geochemical interactions necessary for top-tier prediction.
- Appalachian Basin (With PCA): Shows a moderate R^2 of 0.51, indicating that further tuning or additional data might be needed to improve model performance.
- Great Plains Basin (With PCA): Exhibits an  R^2 close to zero and even negative, highlighting the potential oversimplification by PCA or the complexity of the geochemical background that is not adequately captured.
- Fort Worth Basin (With PCA): Although not deeply negative, an R^2 of 0.28 shows that the PCA model is insufficient for capturing the full range of necessary predictive factors in this basin.

The analysis suggests that Random Forest models without PCA generally provide better predictive performance when they have access to the complete geochemical dataset, as seen in the Gulf Coast and Williston Basins. This indicates that the richness of the full dataset provides a more accurate basis for predicting lithium concentrations, particularly in complex geochemical environments where interactions between numerous variables are critical. While PCA offers benefits in reducing dimensionality and computational demands, its appropriateness varies by the specific characteristics of each basin's geochemical profile. The effectiveness of models without PCA in certain basins advocates for a cautious approach to dimensionality reduction, suggesting that retaining more comprehensive data may sometimes be advantageous for maintaining predictive accuracy in Random Forest models.

## Neural Network for Lithium Concentration Prediction

### Methodology
The Neural Network models were constructed using Keras, with a configuration optimized for geochemical data analysis. Each model comprised an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The first hidden layer had 128 neurons, and the second had 64 neurons, both utilizing the ReLU activation function for non-linearity. The output layer consisted of a single neuron for predicting lithium concentrations. The Adam optimizer was employed with a learning rate of 0.001, and the loss function used was mean squared error to minimize the prediction error.

For data handling, two scenarios were utilized:

- **PCA-Transformed Data**: The models were fed the first 10 principal components, representing over 90% of the variance in the dataset, to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most significant features.
- **Imputed Data Without PCA**: The models used the full set of imputed geochemical features to capture all potential interactions and provide a comprehensive basis for prediction.

Both datasets were divided into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% reserved for testing, to evaluate model performance and generalizability.

### Model Performance Across Geological Basins
The performance analysis of Neural Network models on PCA-transformed and imputed data without PCA reveals distinct patterns that underscore the influence of data preprocessing techniques on predictive accuracy in geological settings. Focusing on the R^2 value, which assesses the proportion of variance in lithium concentrations that the model can predict, we establish a threshold of 0.75 to evaluate effective predictive performance. Here’s a detailed examination of how each scenario fares across various basins:

### Predictive Performance
Models that exceed the R^2 threshold of 0.75 demonstrate a robust ability to predict lithium concentrations, suggesting that the models have successfully captured the key geochemical interactions required for accurate predictions:

- Anadarko Basin (PCA-Transformed Data): Achieving an R^2 of 0.81, the model effectively uses the principal components to capture essential data variability, indicating that the PCA approach is well-suited for this basin’s geochemical data structure.
- Fort Worth Basin (PCA-Transformed Data): With an R^2 of 0.87, this basin shows excellent model performance, suggesting that the dominant geochemical features influencing lithium concentrations are well-represented by the top principal components.
- Gulf Coast Basin (PCA-Transformed Data): An R^2 of 0.85 highlights the model's capability to efficiently utilize reduced dimensions to predict lithium concentrations accurately, reinforcing the effectiveness of PCA in maintaining crucial information while reducing noise.
- Appalachian Basin: Experiencing an R^2 of 0.60 with PCA and even lower without PCA, these results suggest that neither data handling strategy adequately captures the complex geochemical interactions necessary for accurate lithium prediction in this region.
- Great Plains Basin (PCA-Transformed Data): The near-zero R^2 value indicates a failure in the model's ability to generalize the data's underlying patterns, possibly due to the inherently complex geochemical background that requires more data.
- Permian, Oklahoma Platform, and Williston Basins (Without PCA): The significantly negative R^2 values suggest that removing PCA leads to models that are not only ineffective but potentially detrimental in their current configuration. This could be due to overfitting, where models too closely adapt to the training data specifics without gaining the ability to generalize, or due to the presence of misleading or irrelevant features in the comprehensive dataset.

The analysis underscores the importance of appropriate data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques in modeling complex geological datasets. PCA transformation generally enhances model performance by highlighting essential features and omitting redundant or irrelevant data. However, the variability in model success across different basins suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be appropriate. Tailoring data preprocessing and modeling techniques to the specific characteristics of each basin could yield better predictive accuracy. For basins where models underperform, further exploration into alternative machine learning algorithms, enhanced feature engineering, and possibly acquiring more comprehensive or higher-quality data are recommended to improve model outcomes.

In conclusion, while PCA offers substantial benefits in some geological contexts by simplifying the input data and potentially enhancing model accuracy, its application should be carefully considered against the backdrop of each basin's unique geochemical profile to optimize lithium concentration predictions effectively.

## Multi-Target Sequential Chaining
The Multi-Target Sequential Chaining (MTSC) approach leverages a sequential prediction strategy, where the prediction of one target variable aids in the modeling of the next. This technique was applied specifically to the Gulf Coast Basin data, focusing on a series of geochemical elements as targets, which are crucial in predicting lithium concentrations. The methodology harnesses the power of Gradient Boosting alongside Random Forest, Neural Network (MLP regressor), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Extreme Gradient Boostin (XGB)  within a framework designed to optimize sequential predictions.

### Methodology Overview
- **Data Preparation**: The dataset was initially processed to prioritize target variables based on the count of missing values. The approach was to predict the least problematic variables first and use their predictions as features for subsequent models.
- **Feature Set-Up**: Starting with a set of key geochemical indicators (e.g., TDS, Cl), the model incrementally included newly predicted targets into the feature set, enhancing the predictor space as it moved through the target list.
- **Model Execution**: For each target, a variety of models were evaluated through a rigorous GridSearchCV process to identify the optimal configuration. Models included Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, MLPRegressor, SVR, and XGBRegressor, each configured with a specific set of hyperparameters suitable for regression tasks.

### Performance Comparison
The performance of Gradient Boosting was directly compared with other models based on standard regression metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),R^2 score, and Explained Variance. Each model was tuned to minimize MSE and optimize the R^2 score, aiming to exceed an R^2 threshold of 0.75 to be deemed effective.

- **Gradient Boosting**: Showed substantial efficacy in the sequential prediction model, particularly evident in its ability to handle complex nonlinear relationships within the geochemical data. However, while Gradient Boosting often provided strong predictive accuracy, it sometimes fell short in comparison to simpler or more flexible models, particularly in data scenarios characterized by high variability or less straightforward relationships.
- **Best Model Performance**: Among the various models tested, the SVR and XGB emerged as the most effective, particularly for Lithium prediction, achieving the highest R^2 score of 0.798 and 0.792 espectively, underscoring their capability in handling the specific nuances of the geochemical dataset of the Gulf Coast Basin.

### Algorithmic Insights and Recommendations
- **Sequential Benefit**: The sequential approach allowed for nuanced understanding and leveraging of interdependencies among geochemical variables. This strategy is particularly beneficial in complex environmental datasets where the interaction between variables can significantly influence the outcome.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Although Gradient Boosting demonstrated solid performance, the standout results achieved by SVR and XGBRegressor, with R^2 scores of 0.798 and 0.792 respectively, highlight the efficacy of a diversified modeling approach. The strong performances of these models suggest that an ensemble strategy, leveraging the distinct strengths of various algorithms, could be advantageous for enhancing the robustness and accuracy of predictions in complex geochemical environments. This approach would capitalize on the complementary capabilities of different models to address various facets of the prediction task.
