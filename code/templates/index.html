                            This multi-page web application was developed to allow the user to easily view the data visualization outputs generated over the course of two projects. 
                            One project focuses on the concentration of major scaling elements along with Lithium (an element of interest to the DOE) in produced water, and the other focuses 
                            on the induced seismic effects of the class II injection wells used to dispose of it. The abstract for each project is included below to provide an overview 
                            of what to expect from the outputs of each project. Further detail is available in the respective "detailed report" tabs.
                            <br><br>
                            We hope you find this platform to be informative and functional in it's presentation of the data.

                                    <p><br>This web-based project provides an interactive and comprehensive exploration of the relationship between induced seismic activity, saltwater 
                                        disposal (SWD) well injection volumes, and subsurface pore pressure changes within the Delaware Basin in West Texas. Utilizing publicly accessible 
                                        data from TexNet and employing advanced numerical models, the project aims to illuminate the complex interactions that contribute to induced 
                                        seismicity. The website features interactive tabs that allow users to delve into various aspects of the study, including seismic activity in 
                                        relation to SWD wells, produced water chemistry, and a detailed glossary of terms for educational purposes.

                                        The project employs a structured Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) methodology for data preparation, leveraging technologies such as Python's Pandas 
                                        and Pyproj libraries for data manipulation and transformation, and Amazon RDS for database storage. The extracted data setsâ€”comprising pressure 
                                        data from text files, injection volume data from APIs, and seismic event data from APIs are meticulously processed to ensure accuracy and usability.

                                        The core of the website is an interactive geomap analysis tool, hosted within an iframe, which visualizes the temporal and spatial dynamics of 
                                        SWD practices, pore pressure alterations, and seismic events. This tool, alongside additional visualizations of produced water chemistry, aims to 
                                        engage and inform stakeholders, researchers, and the general public about the environmental and operational implications of SWD wells.

                                        Through this digital platform, we endeavor to provide a narrative that connects SWD well operations with seismic activity and water chemistry, 
                                        offering insights into sustainable practices and risk mitigation strategies in the context of oil and gas extraction. The project underscores the 
                                        importance of integrating scientific research with interactive data visualization to foster a broader understanding of induced seismicity and its 
                                        associated challenges.</p>

                                        This project focuses on two key objectives: analyzing the chemistry of produced water with a focus on scaling elements and evaluating the 
                                        availability of lithium for potential extraction. Utilizing data from the

                                        for data cleaning and filtering is employed to ensure accuracy.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The analysis encompasses key elements such as Sodium, Calcium, Chloride, Sulfate, and Magnesium, with a focus on Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) 
                                        greater than 35,000 ppm. Applying natural chemical balance conditions refines the dataset, and stringent charge balance criteria are employed 
                                        for reliability. Missing data are addressed with tailored strategies respecting chemical properties.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Visualizations include box and violin plots showcasing elemental concentrations across geological basins, Piper plots for water type 
                                        classification, and interactive maps revealing scaling element and lithium concentration clusters. The methodology ensures a clear representation 
                                        of scaling element and lithium distribution and facilitates insights into spatial patterns. Furthermore, the project introduces a linear regression 
                                        analysis on lithium concentration versus depth to investigate whether a relationship is present.

                                        In conclusion, this research provides a nuanced understanding of produced water chemistry, supports sustainable water management, aligns with DOE 
                                        goals, and explores the potential for resource recovery. The methodologies presented are adaptable, promoting transparency and fostering

                            <h2 style="color:#CC6600">Abstract</h2>
                            <p>This web-based project provides an interactive and comprehensive exploration of the relationship between induced seismic activity, saltwater disposal (SWD) well injection volumes, and subsurface pore pressure changes within the Delaware Basin, West Texas. Utilizing publicly accessible data from TexNet and employing advanced numerical models, the project aims to illuminate the complex interactions that contribute to induced seismicity. The website features interactive tabs that allow users to delve into various aspects of the study, including seismic activity in relation to SWD wells, produced water chemistry (project 1), and a detailed glossary of terms for educational purposes.</p>

                            <p>The project employs a structured Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) methodology for data preparation, leveraging technologies such as Python's Pandas and Pyproj libraries for data manipulation and transformation, and Amazon RDS for database storage. The extracted data setsâ€”comprising pressure data from text files, injection volume data from APIs, and seismic event dataâ€”are meticulously processed to ensure accuracy and usability.</p>

                            <p>The core of the website is an interactive geomap analysis tool, hosted within an iframe, which visualizes the temporal and spatial dynamics of SWD practices, pore pressure alterations, and seismic events.

                            <h2 style="color:#CC6600">1. Introduction</h2>
                            <p>The significant increase in seismic activity within Texas, notably surpassing California in the occurrence of ML2.5 or higher earthquakes since 2022, marks a critical juncture for both scientific inquiry and environmental stewardship. This uptick in seismic events, particularly concentrated in areas such as the Delaware Basin and the Midland-Odessa area, necessitates a comprehensive examination of the links between seismicity and human interventions, notably those undertaken by the petroleum industry. Our study adopts a targeted approach, merging seismic data from the TexNet public catalog, SWD (Salt Water Disposal) well injection volume data, and pore pressure details from sophisticated gridded numerical models. This concerted effort aims to clarify the complex dynamics between SWD practices and the resulting seismic activity, with a particular focus on the Delaware Basin, a key area for unconventional shale oil and gas extraction that has seen a noticeable increase in seismicity since 2014.</p>

                            <p>A key aspect of our study is the temporal scope, constrained to the period from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2024. This timeframe is dictated by the availability of seismic data from TexNet, ensuring a comprehensive analysis based on the most reliable and complete datasets available. Both seismic and SWD well injection volume data, accessible through TexNet via API calls, are in the public domain, allowing for an open and transparent research process.</p>

                            <p>Our research focuses on illustrating the correlation between seismic activity, SWD well injection volumes, and changes in pore pressure. Through the development of an interactive geomap analysis tool, we visualize how the volume of fluid injected into SWD wells potentially elevates pore pressure and, consequently, affects the seismic activity of faults in the region. This project is driven by the goal of providing a clear visual representation of these relationships, offering valuable insights into how injection practices may influence seismicity. By creating an innovative interactive geomap analysis tool, we aim to provide insights that can help stakeholders, policymakers, and the scientific community devise strategies to mitigate the seismic risks associated with these practices. It reflects our dedication to contributing to the understanding of induced seismicity's environmental and societal impacts, with the ultimate aim of guiding more informed and sustainable practices in petroleum extraction.</p>

                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pressure Data</strong>: Originated from a text file, this dataset was transformed into a CSV format to facilitate easier manipulation and integration into our analysis framework.</li>
                            <li><strong>Injection Volume Data</strong>: Retrieved from an API endpoint (<a href="https://injection.texnet.beg.utexas.edu/api/Export">https://injection.texnet.beg.utexas.edu/api/Export</a>), with specific parameters tailored to extract only the data pertinent to our project's scope.</li>
                            <li><strong>Earthquake Data</strong>: Sourced from another API endpoint (<a href="https://maps.texnet.beg.utexas.edu/arcgis/rest/services/catalog/catalog_all_flat/MapServer/0/query">https://maps.texnet.beg.utexas.edu/arcgis/rest/services/catalog/catalog_all_flat/MapServer/0/query</a>), utilizing targeted parameters to filter the dataset according to our analytical needs. The data was initially loaded in JSON format.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>2.1.2 TRANSFORM</h4>

                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pressure Data</strong>: Upon conversion to a Pandas DataFrame, the dataset was further refined by assigning a layer number to each row and converting the time column into a DateTime format for precise temporal analysis. Additionally, latitude and longitude values were transformed from the NAD 1927 State Plane Texas Central FIPS 4203 format to the WGS84 coordinate system using the pyproj library, ensuring geographical accuracy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Injection Volume Data</strong> & <strong>Earthquake Data</strong>: Both datasets were processed into Pandas DataFrames for subsequent transformation steps.

                            <h2 style="color:#996600">Abstract:</h2>

                            <p>Produced water, a byproduct of oil and gas extraction, poses environmental challenges due to its complex chemical composition and high salinity. This project focuses on two key objectives: analyzing the chemistry of produced water with a focus on scaling elements and evaluating the availability of lithium for potential extraction.

                            <h2 style="color:#996600">1. Introduction:</h2>

                            <h3 style="color:#707070">1.1. Overview of Produced Water</h3>

                            <p>Produced water, the wastewater generated during the extraction of oil and gas and in other industrial processes, presents a significant environmental challenge. This water typically contains various chemicals and dissolved solids. The oil and gas industry often relies on injection wells to manage this produced water, where it is re-injected underground. While this method is efficient and cost-effective, it carries environmental risks, such as potential groundwater contamination and seismic activity inducement.</p>

                            <p>In light of these challenges, the Department of Energy (DOE) has funded research to explore treatment options for high-salinity produced water from the oil and gas industry. This research also aims to investigate the feasibility of extracting critical elements, such as lithium, from produced water, thus turning a waste product into a potential resource.</p>

                            <p>The oil and gas sector faces unique challenges in managing produced water, largely due to its complex chemical composition, high salinity, and the large volumes involved. Various treatment and management techniques are employed, balancing environmental impacts with economic considerations.</p>

                                    <p><br>With over fifteen years of experience in environmental and water resources engineering, my career has been dedicated to advancing sustainable water management 
                                        practices and environmental solutions. My work has primarily focused on analyzing produced water samples to identify critical elements, which has 
                                        significantly contributed to enhancing environmental sustainability and project efficiency.
                                        My expertise extends to conducting geochemical analysis of produced water, uncovering vital data such as the presence of Lithium. This analysis has been 
                                        pivotal in improving water management strategies and understanding environmental impacts in the industry.
                                        I have been enhancing my skills in data analysis and visualization through training in Python, Java Script, SQL, and Tableau. This has equipped me to 
                                        integrate my engineering experience with my growing data analytics proficiency to address environmental challenges more effectively, ensuring the sustainable 
                                        use of water resources.</p>
