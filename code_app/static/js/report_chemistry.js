        <h2 style="color:#996600">1. Introduction:</h2>

        <h3 style="color:#707070">1.1. Overview of Produced Water</h3>

        <p>Produced water, the wastewater generated during the extraction of oil and gas and in other industrial processes, presents a significant environmental challenge. This water typically contains various chemicals and dissolved solids. The oil and gas industry often relies on injection wells to manage this produced water, where it is re-injected underground. While this method is efficient and cost-effective, it carries environmental risks, such as potential groundwater contamination and seismic activity inducement.</p>

        <p>In light of these challenges, the Department of Energy (DOE) has funded research to explore treatment options for high-salinity produced water from the oil and gas industry. This research also aims to investigate the feasibility of extracting critical elements, such as lithium, from produced water, thus turning a waste product into a potential resource.</p>

        <p>The oil and gas sector faces unique challenges in managing produced water, largely due to its complex chemical composition, high salinity, and the large volumes involved. Various treatment and management techniques are employed, balancing environmental impacts with economic considerations.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#707070">1.2. Objectives</h3>

        <p>This project, aligning with DOE's research interests, is centered around two key objectives:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Analyzing the Chemistry of Produced Water: The aim is to understand the composition of produced water and identify elements that lead to scaling in treatment processes, a major impediment in water treatment leading to efficiency losses and increased costs.</li>
            <li>Evaluating Lithium Availability: We assess the potential for lithium extraction from produced water in the oil and gas industry across the U.S. With the current economic feasibility threshold for lithium extraction set at a concentration of 80 mg/l, this project explores the availability of lithium in produced water from different basins across the US, and anticipates future advancements in extraction technologies that could make it more economically viable.</li>
